;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Main functions (skeleton provided in starter code)
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#|
(run-interpreter prog) -> any
  prog: datum?
    A syntactically-valid Rake program.

  Evaluates the Rake program and returns its value, or raises an error if the program is
  not semantically valid.
|#
(define (run-interpreter prog)
  (void))

#|
(interpret env expr) -> any
  env: hash?
    The environment with which to evaluate the expression.
  expr: datum?
    A syntactically-valid Rake expression.

  Returns the value of the Rake expression under the given environment.
|#
(define (interpret env expr)
  (void))


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Helpers: Builtins and closures
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; A hash mapping symbols for Rake builtin functions to their corresponding Racket value.
(define builtins
  (hash
   '+ +
   'equal? equal?
   '< <
   'integer? integer?
   'boolean? boolean?
   ; Note: You'll almost certainly need to replace procedure? here to properly return #t
   ; when given your closure data structure at the end of Task 1!
   'procedure? procedure?
   ))

; Returns whether a given symbol refers to a builtin Rake function.
(define (builtin? identifier) (hash-has-key? builtins identifier))

Starter definition for a closure "struct". Racket structs behave similarly to
C structs (contain fields but no methods or encapsulation).
Read more at https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/define-struct.html.

You can and should modify this as necessary. If you're having trouble working with
Racket structs, feel free to switch this implementation to use a list/hash instead.
